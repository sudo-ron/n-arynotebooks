    "**Remark.** (i) The total degree of a univariate polynomial ($v = 1$) is just its degree. We may use the terms _degree_ and _total degree_ interchangeably. (ii) The zero polynomial is denoted by $0$; context should make it clear when this symbol represents the zero polynomial rather than the zero element of the field. The nonzero constant polynomials are precisely those of total degree $0$. We leave the degree of the zero polynomial undefined. Some authors, however, define it as $-\\infty$ for convenience, which simplifies statements like $\\mathrm{deg}(g_1 + g_2) \\le \\max\\{\\mathrm{deg}(g_1),\\mathrm{deg}(g_2)\\}$ and $\\mathrm{def}(g_1g_2) = \\mathrm{deg}(g_1) + \\mathrm{deg}(g_2)$, without needing to exclude the zero polynomial as a special case.

For instance, if $v > 1$ then $g(X_0,r_1,\\ldots,r_{v-1})$ denotes the univariate polynomial in the indeterminate $X_0$, obtained by substituting $X_1,\\ldots,X_{v - 1}$ with $r_1,\\ldots,r_{v - 1}$ in the RHS. For a more explicit example: if $g(X_0,X_1,X_2) = X_0X_1X_2 + X_0X_1^2 + X_2$ then $g(X_0,1,1) = 2X_0 + 1$.\n",

Polynomials are really just sequences of coefficients that we add and multiply in a certain way. Indeterminates $X_j$ serve as placeholders&mdash;not variables&mdash;to allow us to work with abstract algebraic rules of addition and multiplication. If this remark seems opaque, consider that a univariate polynomial can be represented as a sequence of coefficients $(a_0, a_1, a_2, \\ldots)$, where only finitely many $a_i$ are nonzero. Given two polynomials $g = (a_0, a_1, a_2, \\ldots)$ and $h = (b_0, b_1, b_2, \\dots)$, their product $g \\cdot h$ is another sequence of coefficients $(c_0, c_1, c_2, \\ldots)$ defined by $c_k = \\sum_{i=0}^n a_i b_{k-i}$."

This insight has useful implications; for instance, it suggests that two multivariate polynomials over a field are unlikely to agree at a randomly selected point, which is the crux of the soundness error in the sum-check protocol.\n",

In fact, for the special case of finite fields—which is the only case relevant here—the result was originally established by Ore in the 1922 [[ORE1922]](#ore1922).\n",

    "\n",
    "_Proof outline_. Suppose $r_0 \\in \\mathbb{F}$ is a root of $g$, so $g(r_0) = 0$. By the division algorithm, we can factor $g(X) = (X - r_0) q(X)$, where $q(X) \\in \\mathbb{F}[X]$ has degree $d - 1$. If $r_0$ is a repeated root, then we can factor $g$ further as $g(X) = (X - r_0)^{m_0} q_0(X)$, where $m_0 \\geq 1$ is maximal (i.e., $q_0(r_0) \\neq 0$). At this point, $q_0(X)$ is a polynomial of degree $d - m_0$. Now, if there is another root $r_1 \\neq r_0$, then $g(r_1) = 0$ implies $q_0(r_1) = 0$ because $(r_1 - r_0)^{m_0} \\neq 0$ (fields have no zero divisors). Therefore, $q_0(X)$ must also be divisible by $(X - r_1)$, allowing us to write $g(X) = (X - r_0)^{m_0} (X - r_1) q_1(X)$ for some polynomial $q_1(X)$ of degree $d - m_0 - 1$. We can repeat this process, factoring out distinct roots until we have exhausted the degree $d$. Since each distinct root reduces the degree of the remaining polynomial by at least $1$, the number of roots (counted with multiplicity) cannot exceed $d$. Thus, $g$ can have at most $d$ roots in $\\mathbb{F}$, counted with multiplicity. This argument also generalizes to any integral domain $R$, where the absence of zero divisors ensures that a similar factorization process holds."

Notably, the acceptance condition might still hold even if $g^*_0(r_0) \\ne g_0(r_0)$.
